## About The Project 

The holiday season is a time for celebration that should be shared with many. Some go above and beyond, creating glamorous christmas displays that deserve to be seen, but not always are. Our team was inspired by this problem to create an app that makes such events easier to find.

Advertising residential events beyond friends and family to the greater public is a problem that does not have a direct solution. That is where My FrontYard comes in.

My FrontYard is an intuitive app designed to allow hosts to advertise their residential events and allows other users to access event information and plan their journey to said events.

These events include:
- Christmas light decorations
- Garage Sales 
- Halloween decorations
